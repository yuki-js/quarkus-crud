# JUnit Platform Configuration for Test Execution

# Disable JUnit's parallel execution as Quarkus tests use Gradle's maxParallelForks instead
# This prevents race conditions during application context initialization
junit.jupiter.execution.parallel.enabled=false

# Note: Parallel test execution is configured at the Gradle level using maxParallelForks
# which runs test classes in separate JVM processes. This is the recommended approach
# for Quarkus integration tests to avoid context sharing issues.
