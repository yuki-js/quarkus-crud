 * @QuarkusIntegrationTest because the native binary runs as a separate process.
 *
 * <p>LLM functionality is tested in native mode via LlmBasicIntegrationIT which includes tests
 * that don't require custom WireMock configuration. WireMock-dependent tests (high variance,
 * Japanese names, error simulation, rate limiting) are only tested in JVM mode.
